# Gnome + bspwm
Tested on Ubuntu 25.04. *Im pretty sure riverwm or any wayland based would work to, but I couldnt get it working in vm.*

## Setup
Add `bspwm.desktop` to `/usr/share/xsessions/` with:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=bspwm
Comment=Binary space partitioning window manager
Exec=bspwm
Type=Application
```
